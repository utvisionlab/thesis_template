In this research, we cast natural-image segmentation as a problem of clustering feature vectors extracted from image textures.
We model the distribution of the texture features using a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions.
In the proposed algorithm, by fitting these models to the data we segment the image using an agglomerative clustering algorithm based on the likelihood of the fit.
We conduct comprehensive experiments to measure the performance of the algorithm in terms of visual evaluation and a variety of quantitative indices, and we also compare it to other well-known image-segmentation methods.
While moving the project forward, we have also developed a software package for working with mixture models, which provides the facilities required to estimate the parameters of these models.
